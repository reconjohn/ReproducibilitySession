\begin{abstract}
This is an example on how to make a reproducible paper. We are using R from Rstudio, creating an RSweave document. This is a nice start to create a nice paper and get an A+. The next sections will show the steps taken.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}  

This is my intro to my great paper, I will explain the cool things I can do with my new `computational thinking' powers combined with some Latex.

\section{Exploring Data}\label{explo}


Sections may use a label\footnote{In fact, you can have a label wherever you think a future reference to that content might be needed.}. This label is needed for referencing. For example the next section has label \emph{datas}, so you can reference it by writing: As we see in section \ref{catexplo}.







\subsection{Exploring Categorical Data}\label{catexplo}

\section{My Regression}\label{regre}

This is a Regression in R:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> regre1=lm(FHF~RWB,data=dataidx)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

This is another:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> regre2=lm(FHF~RWB+ONIpolitical,data=dataidx)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

These is a better summary, and for both:
